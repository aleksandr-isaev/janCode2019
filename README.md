## Pre-Release

#### Key Terms
- Kilometre – 1000meters.
- Pace – how much time it takes to cover a given distance, eg minutes/km
- Speed – how much distance you can cover in a given amount of time, eg km/h.
- Run analysis – data generated from your run data
- PB – personal best, the fastest you have done a certain distance

#### Back Ground
You have been approached by Adidas to produce new run tracking software. They have developed the initial program but require you to fix some errors and add some additional functionality.

#### The System
Currently the system allows up to 10 users to register with the system. The users are identified with a unique username and password.
When using the system a user can perform 4 actions:
1. Add New User
2. Add New Run
3. Output History
4. Ten Km Goal Analysis
0. Exit

#### Explanations
#### 1. New User
A new user can register supplying 3 pieces of data: a unique username; a strong password; their 10 km goal time (in seconds). Following validation the user’s new account will be set up and their data stored.

#### 2. Add New Run
A user will have to log in using their username and password. If the log in is correct then they will be able to add a new time and distance for a run they have performed.

#### 3. Output History
Display the users run history and relevant data

#### 4. Ten Km Goal Analysis
When the user selects to view their 10 km goal analysis the system should provide the user with key information and analysis about their run history and progress towards their 10km goal.

#### 0. Exit
The software shutdown
